## 🧩 Learning Goals

By the end of this lesson, you should be able to:

- Write a `for` loop in R to handle repeated tasks
    - Use `seq_along()` and `seq_len()` to iterate over vectors or rows of a data frame
    - Store output from a `for` loop in a list or other storage container
- Recognize that vectorized functions help us avoid `for` loops in many situations
- Use the `across()` function to wrangle multiple variables simultaneously


## Iteration 

When we want to reuse code, we can use:

- functions to save the steps of the task
- iteration to apply that function to new inputs


Let's talk about iteration in R.

- Iterating using a `for` loop & how to do it appropriately in R (today)
- Iterating `across` data frame columns (today)
- Iterating using `map` and `walk` for iteration, instead of a `for` loop (next class)


## Purposes of Iteration 

**Creating or saving a new object**

- Performing an action with a return output
- Ex. creating new variables/datasets, fitting models, etc.
- We'll need to consider storage (memory allocation).
- Next class, we'll use `map()` for this...


**Side effects**

- Performing an action without a R return output
- Ex: saving data using `write_csv()` or saving a plot with `png()`
- We don't need to worry about storage in R.
- We could use `walk()` for this...


```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```


## `for` loops 

In R, `for` loops have the following general structure:

```{r for_syntax}
#| eval: false

for (i in some_vector) {
    # Code to do stuff based on i
}
```


`some_vector` can be **any** vector, including:

- An **indexing** integer vector: `1:3` [Most common!]
- A character vector: `c("group1", "group2", "group3")`
- A vector of any other class

```{r for_examples}
groups <- c("group1", "group2", "group3") # a vector to iterate over
 
for (i in 1:3) { # i: index
    print(groups[i])
}

for (g in groups) { # iterating over the vector
    print(g)
}
```


To iterate over an **indexing** vector, it is useful to know about the following two functions:

- `seq_along(v)`: generates an integer sequence from 1 to the length of the vector `v` supplied
- `seq_len(n)`:  generates an integer sequence from 1 to `n`


```{r for_seq_along}
for (i in seq_along(groups)) {
    print(groups[i])
}

for (i in seq_len(length(groups))) {
    print(groups[i])
}
```


A nice feature of `seq_along()` is that it generates an empty iteration vector if the vector you're iterating over itself has length 0.

```{r}
no_groups <- c()
seq_along(no_groups)
for (i in seq_along(no_groups)) {
    print(no_groups[i])
}
```


`seq_len()` is useful for iterating over the rows of a data frame because `seq_along()` would iterate over columns:

```{r seq_len_df}
small_data <- tibble(a = 1:2, b = 2:3, c = 4:5)

for (col in small_data) { # each element is the column 
    print(col)
}

for (r in seq_len(nrow(small_data))) {
    print(r)
}
```


**Indexing** is particularly important when we want to create/save new objects as we need to store output created during a `for` loop. 

::: {.callout-tip appearance='simple' icon=false}
When using a for loop to create/save output, we should create storage containers ahead of time with the `vector()` function. This allocates memory for the output and is a more efficient use of memory. 
:::

```{r store_results}
char_storage <- vector("character", length = 3)
num_storage <- vector("numeric", length = 3)
list_storage <- vector("list", length = 3)

char_storage
num_storage
list_storage

for (i in seq_len(3)) {
    char_storage[i] <- str_c("Number: ", i)
    num_storage[i] <- 2*i
    list_storage[[i]] <- i # Note the [[ for subsetting here
}

char_storage
num_storage
list_storage
```

### `for` loops and memory allocation   

If you don't create a storage container ahead of time, you will regret it. Let's bench mark our code to see the difference!

```{r}
# Example 1: No storage container; append new value to existing vector
library(bench)
x <- integer()

bench::mark(
  for (i in 1:1e5) {
    x <- c(x, i)
  }
)

# Example 2: Using a storage container!
#Notice median (time to run), mem_alloc (how much memory you are using), and gc (garbage collection)
x <- vector('integer', length = 1e5)
bench::mark(
  for (i in 1:1e5) {
    x[i] <- i
  }
)


# Example 3: Vectorized function
#Notice median (time to run), mem_alloc (how much memory you are using), and gc (garbage collection)
bench::mark(
  x <- seq(1, 1e5, by = 1)
)

```

## Exercises 

**Pair programming exercises:** Whoever has most recently eaten dessert (broadly interpreted) should be the driver first. Switch after Exercise 2.

Write `for`-loops that do each of the following:

1. Prints the even numbers from 2:20
    - Then, produce the same output with the `seq()` function
    
```{r}    
# for loop
for (i in seq_len(10)) {
    print(2*i)
}

# for (i in seq(2, 20, by=2)) {
#     print(2*i)
# }

# vectorized approach with `seq()`
seq(from = 2, to = 20, by = 2)

```
    
2. Iterates over the `month.name` vector and stores a character vector of output containing strings like "Month 1: January", "Month 2: February".
    - Then, produce the same output with `str_c()` only.
    
```{r}    
# for loop

for (name in month.name){
  i = i + 1
  print(str_c("Month ", i, ": ", name))
}

# vectorized approach with `str_c()`
str_c("Month"," ", seq(1,12),": ", month.name)
```

3. On the `diamonds` dataset, fit stratified models of price vs. carat, model separately estimated for each value of `cut`, and store the fitted models in a list storage container.

```{r}    
# for loop
# Fit models of price vs. carat separately for each value of cut
unique_cuts <- diamonds |> pull(cut) |> levels()
lin_mod_results <- vector(mode = "list", length = length(unique_cuts))

diamonds

for (i in unique(diamonds$cut)) {
  print(i)
  
}
```


```{r}
data(diamonds)

# Fit models of price vs. carat separately for each value of cut
unique_cuts <- diamonds |> pull(cut) |> levels()
lin_mod_results <- vector(mode = "list", length = length(unique_cuts))

for (i in seq_along(unique_cuts)) {
    this_cut <- unique_cuts[i]
    diamonds_sub <- diamonds |>
        filter(cut==this_cut)
    # The double square brackets [[i]] accesses the ith element of a list
    lin_mod_results[[i]] <- lm(price ~ carat, data = diamonds_sub)
}
```




## Iteration `across` data frame columns 

Often we will have to perform the same data wrangling on many variables (e.g., rounding numbers)

```{r no_across}
diamonds |>
    mutate(
        carat = round(carat, 1),
        x = round(x, 1),
        y = round(y, 1),
        z = round(z, 1)
    )
```

`dplyr` provides the `across()` function for performing these repeated function calls:

```{r with_across}
# Option 1: Create our own named function
round_to_one <- function(x) {
    round(x, digits = 1)
}
diamonds |> 
    mutate(across(.cols = c(carat, x, y, z), .fns = round_to_one))
```

```{r}
# Option 2: Use an "anonymous" or "lambda" function that isn't named/saved
diamonds |> 
    mutate(across(.cols = c(carat, x, y, z), .fns = function(x) {round(x, digits = 1)} ))


# Anonymous functions can be written in a more concise way
# function(x){ length(unique(x)) } OR ~ length(unique(.x))
# function(x,y){ length(unique(x + y)) } OR ~ length(unique(.x + .y))
```



When we look at the [documentation for `across()`](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/across.html), we see that the `.cols` argument specifies which variables we want to transform, and it has a `<tidy-select>` tag. This means that the syntax we use for `.cols` follows certain rules. 

Let's click [this link](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/dplyr_tidy_select.html) to explore the possibilities for selecting variables.

- Read through the "Overview of selection features" section to get an overall sense of the many ways to select variables.
- Navigate back to the `across()` documentation and read through the Examples section at the bottom. Click the "Run examples" link to view the output for all of the examples.



What if we wanted to perform multiple transformations on each of many variables? 


Within the different values of diamond `cut`, let's summarize the mean, median, and standard deviation of the numeric variables. When we look at the `.fns` argument in the `across()` documentation, we see that we can provide a **list** of functions:

```{r across_many_fns}
diamonds |>
    group_by(cut) |> 
    summarize(across(.cols = where(is.numeric), .fns = list(mean = mean, med = median, sd = sd)))
```

What does the list of functions look like? What is the structure of this list object?

```{r list_str}
list_of_fcts <- list(mean = mean, med = median, sd = sd)
list_of_fcts
str(list_of_fcts)
```



## Exercises 

Using the `diamonds` dataset:

1. Transform the `x`, `y`, and `z` columns so that the units of millimeters are displayed (e.g., "4.0 mm").

```{r}

```

2. Convert all numeric columns into character columns.
    - Hint: type `is.` and hit Tab in the Console. Scroll through the function options. Do the same with `as.`

```{r}

```




## Case study: performing many different versions of an analysis 

One of my most common use cases for writing functions and iteration/looping is to perform some exploration or modeling repeatedly for several different "settings". 

For example, our broad goal might be to fit a linear regression model to our data. However, there are often multiple choices that we have to make in practice:

- Keep missing values or fill them in (imputation)?
- Fit the model only on a certain group of cases?
- Filter out outliers in one or more variables?
- Transform certain variables? (e.g., log transformation)


We can map any number of these choices to **arguments** in a custom model-fitting function:

- `impute`: TRUE or FALSE
- `filter_to`: This could be a string description like "All cases", "Group 1", or "Groups 1 and 2"

```{r fit_model_example}
fit_model <- function(data, impute, filter_to) {
    if (impute) {
        data <- some_imputation_function(data)
    }
    
    if (filter_to=="Group 1") {
        data <- data |> 
            filter(group == 1)
    } else if (filter_to == "Groups 1 and 2") {
        data <- data |> 
            filter(group %in% c(1,2))
    }
    
    lm(y ~ x1 + x2, data = data)
}
```

The `tidyr` package has a useful function called `crossing()` that is useful for generating argument combinations. 

For each argument, we specify all possible values for that argument. `crossing()` generates all combinations:

```{r}
df_arg_combos <- crossing(
    impute = c(TRUE, FALSE),
    filter_to = c("All cases", "Group 1", "Groups 1 and 2")
)
df_arg_combos

# Another example
crossing(
    option1 = 1:3,
    option2 = c(TRUE, FALSE),
    option3 = c("low", "medium", "high")
)
```

With iteration in our toobox, we can iterate the `fit_model()` function over the combinations in `df_arg_combos`.

## Exercises 

**Goal:** In the `diamonds` dataset, we want to understand the relationship between `price` and size (`carat`). We want to explore variation along two choices:

- The variables included in the model. We'll explore 3 sets of variables:
    - No further variables (just `price` and `carat`)
    - Adjusting for `cut`
    - Adjusting for `cut` and `clarity`
    - Adjusting for `cut`, `clarity`, and `color`
- Whether or not to remove outliers in the `carat` variable. We'll define outliers as cases whose `carat` is over 3 SDs away from the mean.

Work with your partner on the following exercises. As you work, make note of what is challenging and any helpful thought processes/strategies that arise from the collaboration.

1. Use `crossing()` to create the data frame of argument combinations for our analyses. Call it `df_arg_combos`. Note that you can create a list of **formula** objects in R with `c(y ~ x1, y ~ x1 + x2)`. (Something like this will be the right hand side of an argument to `crossing()`.)

```{r}

```

2. Write a function called `remove_outliers` that removes outliers in a dataset. The user should be able to supply the dataset (`data`), the variable to remove outliers in (`what_var`), and a threshold on the number of SDs away from the mean used to define outliers (`sd_thresh`). Write your function so that it runs as follows: `remove_outliers(diamonds, what_var = carat, sd_thresh = 3)`.

```{r}

```

3. Write a function called `fit_model` that implements the different settings for our `diamonds` analysis.

```{r eval=FALSE}
fit_model <- function(data, mod_formula, remove_outliers) {
    # remove_outliers is a TRUE/FALSE flag of whether or not to remove outliers
    # This function implements our specific use case: outliers are cases that are 3 SDs away from the mean for the carat variable
    
    # Use mod_formula as the first argument of lm()
}
```




4. Write a `for` loop that stores the fitted linear models from all versions of the analysis.

Recall that you can pull out the contents of a single data frame column in many ways. For a data frame `df` with a variable named `x`:

- `df$x`
- `df |> pull(x)`
- `df[["x"]]`

Note that in `df_arg_combos`:

- `mod_formula`: this column is a **list** and you can extract the 1st element with `[[1]]`
- `remove_outliers`: this column is a **vector** and you can extract the 1st element with `[1]`

```{r}

```
