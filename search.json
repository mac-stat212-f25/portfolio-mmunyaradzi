most of which are sparsely populated areas with relatively lower crime totals, though this does not necessarily imply safety, as underreporting and other factors might influence statistics",

Using both the small thumbnail visuals on the right and the names of the geom’s, brainstorm some possibilities for geom’s you might use to recreate the temperature visualization.\n\ngeom_ribbon\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNavigating Documentation / Reference Pages\n\n\n\nYou need to navigate the geoms further by opening up their reference pages to understand if a particular geom is suitable for our task. Let’s look at the geom_point documentation page to learn how to read a documentation page..\nThe Usage section shows all of the possible inputs (arguments) to the geom. These are all of the ways that a geom can be customized. Just looking at the argument names can help give a hint as to what arguments might fit our needs.\nThe Arguments section, on the other hand, explains in detail what each argument does and the possible values the argument can take. The mapping, data, and ... arguments will be the most commonly used by far.\n\n\nmapping is the argument that is being used when we specify which variables should link or map to the plot aesthetics (the code inside aes()).\n\ndata is the argument where we specify the dataset containing the variables that the geom is using.\n\n... is used for fixed aesthetics (ones that don’t correspond to a variable), eg, to set the color of all points, we use color = \"red\" and to set the size of all points, we use size = 3.\n\nThe Aesthetics section of a geom documentation page gives information on how the visual elements of the geom correspond to data. For example, the geom_point documentation page shows that x and y aesthetics are available. It also shows some new aesthetics like stroke.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndata Argument\n\n\n\nPreviously you have used one dataset per plot by specifying that as the first argument of ggplot(). However, multiple data sets can be passed into ggplot as shown in the example below.\n\nCodedata(diamonds)\n\ndiamonds_avg_price &lt;- diamonds |&gt;\n  group_by(carat) |&gt;\n  summarize(avg_price = mean(price)) |&gt;\n  arrange(carat)\ndiamonds_avg_price &lt;- diamonds_avg_price[seq(1, nrow(diamonds_avg_price), 3), ]\n\nggplot(diamonds, aes(x = carat, y = price)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_point(\n    data = diamonds_avg_price,\n    aes(x = carat, y = avg_price),\n    color = \"deepskyblue\",\n    size = 3\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLook at the geom_linerange documentation page and start off your temperature visualization with the record lows and highs. Your plot should look like the one below. The hex code of the used light tan color is #ECEBE3.\n\n\nSFO Weather Records in 2011\n\n\nCodelibrary(gridExtra)\n\nggplot(weather) +\n    theme_classic()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKeyboard Shortcuts\n\n\n\nAs you work on this plot, try to use some new keyboard shortcuts.

Using the class() function we can check the class (type) of object that we just read in. Note the presence of the “sf” and “data.frame” classes:\n\nCodeclass(nc)\n\n[1] \"sf\"         \"data.frame\"\n\nCodeclass(mn_cities)\n\n[1] \"sf\"         \"data.frame\"\n\nCodeclass(mn_water)\n\n[1] \"sf\"         \"data.frame\"\n\n\nWhen we read in spatial objects, it is useful to check what CRS underlies the data. We can do that with st_crs() from the sf package:\n\nCodest_crs(nc)\n\nCoordinate Reference System:\n  User input: NAD27 \n  wkt:\nGEOGCRS[\"NAD27\",\n    DATUM[\"North American Datum 1927\",\n        ELLIPSOID[\"Clarke 1866\",6378206.4,294.978698213898,\n            LENGTHUNIT[\"metre\",1]]],\n    PRIMEM[\"Greenwich\",0,\n        ANGLEUNIT[\"degree\",0.0174532925199433]],\n    CS[ellipsoidal,2],\n        AXIS[\"latitude\",north,\n            ORDER[1],\n            ANGLEUNIT[\"degree\",0.0174532925199433]],\n        AXIS[\"longitude\",east,\n            ORDER[2],\n            ANGLEUNIT[\"degree\",0.0174532925199433]],\n    ID[\"EPSG\",4267]]\n\n\nWe can treat sf objects similarly to ordinary datasets when using ggplot2 to make spatial visualizations:\n\nCodeggplot(nc) +\n    geom_sf() +\n    theme_classic() +\n    labs(title = \"NAD27\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChange CRS\n\nLet’s explore how changing the CRS changes the map. The st_transform() function in sf re-expresses a spatial object using a user-supplied CRS. The crs argument takes a string descriptor of the CRS. We can find these descriptors via https://epsg.io.

Below we only plot large cities, and we color and size cities according to their population.\n\n\nCodeggplot() +\n    geom_sf(data = mn_counties, fill = \"white\") + \n    geom_sf(data = mn_cities |&gt; filter(Population &gt;= 10000), mapping = aes(color = Population, size = Population)) + # cities layer\n    scale_color_viridis_c() + # continuous (gradient) color scale\n    labs(title = \"Minnesota Cities with Population &gt;= 10,000\") + \n    ggthemes::theme_map() +\n    theme(legend.position = \"bottom\") # move legend\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLook up the scale_color_viridis_c() documentation via the ggplot2 reference.\n\nRead the function description at the top. What is the advantage of using this function for making color palettes?\nLook through the examples section. What is the difference between the _d(), _c(), and _b() variants of this function?\n\n\nThe _d() variant is used when color is mapped to a discrete (categorical) variable e.g gender, haorcolor.\n\n\nThe _c() variant is used when color is mapped to a continuous variable e.g temperature\n\n\nThe _b() variant is used when color is mapped to a continuous variable but when we want that continuous variable to be binned so that there is a small set of colors.\n\nAdding Elevation Raster Data\nWhere are large cities located? Is there some relationship to local geography/terrain?\n\nTo investigate these questions, we can obtain elevation data to include on the map using the elevatr package. We encounter two new functions here—we can look up their documentation to make sense of the code by entering the following in the Console:\n\n\n?elevatr::get_elev_raster\n?terra::as.data.frame\n\n\nCodeelevation &lt;- elevatr::get_elev_raster(mn_counties, z = 5, clip = \"bbox\")\nraster::crs(elevation) &lt;- sf::st_crs(mn_counties)\n\n# Convert to data frame for plotting\nelev_df &lt;- elevation |&gt; terra::as.data.frame(xy = TRUE)\ncolnames(elev_df) &lt;- c(\"x\", \"y\", \"elevation\")\n\n\nBuild on our existing map by adding a raster layer for elevation as the background.\n\nLook up the documentation for geom_raster() to plot the elevation data from elev_df. This will be the first layer of the plot.\nLook at the documentation for scale_fill_gradient() to add the following elevation color scale: \"darkgreen\" represents the lowest elevations, and \"white\" represents the highest elevations.\nAdd in the layers from the map above to show the largest cities and the county outlines. To remove a background color, use fill = NA.\n\n\nCodeggplot() +\n    geom_raster(data = elev_df, aes(x = x, y = y, fill = elevation)) + # adding the elevation as first (bottom) layer\n    scale_fill_gradient(low = \"darkgreen\", high = \"white\", guide = FALSE) +\n    geom_sf(data = mn_counties, fill = NA, color = \"black\") + \n    geom_sf(data = mn_cities |&gt; filter(Population &gt;= 10000), mapping = aes(color = Population, size = Population))+ # cities layer\n    scale_color_viridis_c() + # continuous (gradient) color scale\n    labs(title = \"Minnesota Cities with Population &gt;= 10,000\") + \n    ggthemes::theme_map() +\n    theme(legend.position = \"bottom\") # move legend\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nZoom in to Twin Cities and Add Water\n\nThe bulk of the interesting information in this map is in the Twin Cities area. Let’s zoom in to this area.\n\n\nWe can use the st_bbox() function to get the bounding box for a spatial object—we do this after filtering to the 7 counties in the Twin Cities.\nWe then use st_crop() to trim a spatial object to a given bounding box.\n\n\nCodeseven_countyarea &lt;- mn_counties |&gt;\n    filter(name %in% c(\"Anoka\", \"Hennepin\", \"Ramsey\", \"Dakota\", \"Carver\", \"Washington\", \"Scott\")) |&gt; \n    st_bbox()\nseven_countyarea\n\n     xmin      ymin      xmax      ymax \n 419967.1 4924212.8  521254.8 5029157.4 \n\nCodeelevation &lt;- elevatr::get_elev_raster(mn_counties |&gt; st_crop(seven_countyarea), z = 9, clip = \"bbox\")\nraster::crs(elevation) &lt;- sf::st_crs(mn_counties)\n\n# Convert to data frame for plotting\nelev_df &lt;- elevation |&gt; terra::as.data.frame(xy = TRUE)\ncolnames(elev_df) &lt;- c(\"x\", \"y\", \"elevation\")\n\n\nIn the plot below, we add a layer for water information and a coord_sf() layer to restrict the x and y-axis limits to the Twin Cities bounding box. (Without this layer, the map would zoom back out to show all counties and bodies of water).\n\nCodeggplot() +\n    geom_raster(data = elev_df, aes(x = x, y = y, fill = elevation)) + \n    geom_sf(data = mn_counties, fill = NA, color = \"black\") + # county boundary layer\n    geom_sf(data = mn_water, fill = \"lightsteelblue1\", color = \"lightsteelblue1\") + # NEW: river/lake layer\n    geom_sf(data = mn_cities |&gt; filter(Population &gt;= 10000), mapping = aes(color = Population, size = Population)) + # cities layer\n    scale_color_viridis_c(option = \"magma\") + # continuous (gradient) color scale\n    scale_fill_gradient(low = \"darkgreen\", high = \"white\") + # continuous (gradient) fill scale\n    coord_sf(xlim = seven_countyarea[c(\"xmin\", \"xmax\")], ylim = seven_countyarea[c(\"ymin\", \"ymax\")]) + # NEW: crop map to Twin Cities bounding box\n    labs(title = \"Twin Cities with Population &gt;= 10,000\") + \n    ggthemes::theme_map() +\n    theme(legend.position = \"none\") # remove legend\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLet’s add to the above code chunk to save the map above to an image file called tc_map_zoom.png in the figures folder. The code example below shows a general template for saving a plot to file. Choose a reasonable width and height. (There are also jpeg() and pdf() functions for writing images.)\n\nCodepng(\"relative path to image\", width = width_in_pixels, height = height_in_pixels)\n# Code for creating plot\ndev.off()",

    "text": "Finding patterns in strings with regular expressions\nSuppose that you’re exploring text data looking for places where people describe happiness. There are many ways to search. We could search for the word “happy” but that excludes “happiness” so we might search for “happi”.\nRegular expressions (regex) are a powerful language for describing patterns within strings.\n. . .\n\nCodedata(fruit)\ndata(words)\ndata(sentences)\n\n\nWe can use str_view() with the pattern argument to see what parts of a string match the regex supplied in the pattern argument. (Matches are enclosed in &lt;&gt;.)\n\nCodestr_view(fruit, \"berry\")\n\n [6] │ bil&lt;berry&gt;\n [7] │ black&lt;berry&gt;\n[10] │ blue&lt;berry&gt;\n[11] │ boysen&lt;berry&gt;\n[19] │ cloud&lt;berry&gt;\n[21] │ cran&lt;berry&gt;\n[29] │ elder&lt;berry&gt;\n[32] │ goji &lt;berry&gt;\n[33] │ goose&lt;berry&gt;\n[38] │ huckle&lt;berry&gt;\n[50] │ mul&lt;berry&gt;\n[70] │ rasp&lt;berry&gt;\n[73] │ salal &lt;berry&gt;\n[76] │ straw&lt;berry&gt;\n\n\nEssentials of forming a regex\n\nLetters and numbers in a regex are matched exactly and are called literal characters.\nMost punctuation characters, like ., +, *, [, ], and ?, have special meanings and are called metacharacters.\n\nQuantifiers come after a regex and control how many times a pattern can match:\n\n\n?: match the preceding pattern 0 or 1 times\n\n+: match the preceding pattern at least once\n\n*: match the preceding pattern at least 0 times (any number of times)\n\n\n\n. . .\nExercise: Before running the code below, predict what matches will be made. Run the code to check your guesses. Note that in all regex’s below the ?, +, * applies to the b only (not the a).\n\nCodestr_view(c(\"a\", \"ab\", \"abb\"), \"ab?\")\nstr_view(c(\"a\", \"ab\", \"abb\"), \"ab+\")\nstr_view(c(\"a\", \"ab\", \"abb\"), \"ab*\")\n\n\n\nWe can match any of a set of characters with [] (called a character class), e.g., [abcd] matches “a”, “b”, “c”, or “d”.\n\nWe can invert the match by starting with ^: [^abcd] matches anything except “a”, “b”, “c”, or “d”.\n\n\n\n\nCode# Match words that have vowel-x-vowel\nstr_view(words, \"[aeiou]x[aeiou]\")\n\n[284] │ &lt;exa&gt;ct\n[285] │ &lt;exa&gt;mple\n[288] │ &lt;exe&gt;rcise\n[289] │ &lt;exi&gt;st\n\nCode# Match words that have not_vowel-y-not_vowel\nstr_view(words, \"[^aeiou]y[^aeiou]\")\n\n[836] │ &lt;sys&gt;tem\n[901] │ &lt;typ&gt;e\n\n\nExercise Using the words data, find words that have two vowels in a row followed by an “m”.\n\nCode# Your code\n\n\n\nThe alternation operator | can be read just like the logical operator | (“OR”) to pick between one or more alternative patterns. e.g., apple|banana searches for “apple” or “banana”.\n\n\nCodestr_view(fruit, \"apple|melon|nut\")\n\n [1] │ &lt;apple&gt;\n[13] │ canary &lt;melon&gt;\n[20] │ coco&lt;nut&gt;\n[52] │ &lt;nut&gt;\n[62] │ pine&lt;apple&gt;\n[72] │ rock &lt;melon&gt;\n[80] │ water&lt;melon&gt;\n\n\nExercise: Using the fruit data, find fruits that have a repeated vowel (“aa”, “ee”, “ii”, “oo”, or “uu”.)\n\nCode# Your code\n\n\n\nThe ^ operator indicates the beginning of a string, and the $ operator indicates the end of a string. e.g., ^a matches strings that start with “a”, and a$ matches words that end with “a”.\nParentheses group together parts of a regular expression that should be taken as a bundle. (Much like parentheses in arithmetic statements.)\n\ne.g., ab+ is a little confusing. Does it match “ab” one or more times? Or does it match “a” first, then just “b” one or more times? (The latter, as we saw in an earlier example.) We can be very explicit and use a(b)+.\n\n\n\nExercise: Using the words data, find (1) words that start with “y” and (2) words that don’t start with “y”.\n\nCode# Your code",

    "section": "Missing Data Mechanisms",
    "text": "Missing Data Mechanisms\nThe reasons for which a variable might have missing data are divided into 3 mechanisms: MCAR, MAR, and MNAR.\nWithin a dataset, multiple mechanisms may be present–we need to consider the missingness mechanism for each variable individually.\n\n\n\nMissing completely at random (MCAR):\n\nThe probability of missing data for a variable is the same for all cases. Implies that causes of the missing data are unrelated to the data. (https://stefvanbuuren.name/fimd/sec-MCAR.html)\nExamples:\n\nMeasurement device that runs out of batteries causes the remainder of observations for the day to be missing.\nData entry software requires a particular field to be typo-free, and missing values are introduced when there are typos.\n\n\nImplications for downstream work:\n\nIf a variable has MCAR missingness, a complete case analysis will be unbiased (still valid).\nHowever, with a lot of missing observations, a complete case analysis will suffer from loss of statistical power (ability to detect a real difference), and imputation will be useful to retain the original sample size.\n\n\n\n\n\nMissing at random (MAR):\n\nThe probability of missing data is related to observed variables but unrelated to unobserved information.\nExamples:\n\nBlood pressure measurements tend to be missing in patients in worse health. (Those in worse health are more likely to miss clinic visits.) Better and worse health can be measured by a variety of indicators in their health record.\nIn a survey, older people are more likely to report their income than younger people. Missingness is related to the observed age variable, but not to unobserved information.\n\n\nImplications for downstream work:\n\nTry to use imputation methods that predict the value of the missing variables from other observed variables. Assessing whether this can be done accurately takes some exploration–we’ll explore this shortly.\n\n\n\n\n\nMissing not at random (MNAR):\n\nThe probability of missing data is related to unobserved variables (and probably observed variables too).\nExamples:\n\nBlood pressure measurements are more likely to be missing for those with the highest blood pressure. This is MNAR rather than MAR because the missing data on blood pressure is related to the unobserved values themselves.\nHigh-income individuals may be less likely to report their income.\n\n\nImplications for downstream work:\n\nIdeally, we would learn more about the causes for the missingness. This could allow us to use more informed imputation models.\n\nExample: Biological measurements that tend to be missing because of concentrations that are too low (a phenomenon known as left-censoring). Imputation methods specifically suited to left-censoring are useful here.\n\n\nWe can use imputation methods with different assumptions about the missing data and try out a variety of assumptions. This lets us see how sensitive the results are under various scenarios.\n\nExample: If higher incomes are more likely to be missing, we can make different assumptions about what “high” could be to fill in the missing values and see how our results change under these different assumptions.",

    "text": "Functions and Control Structures\nWhy functions?\nGetting really good at writing useful and reusable functions is one of the best ways to increase your expertise in data science. It requires a lot of practice.\nIf you’ve copied and pasted code 3 or more times, it’s time to write a function. Try to avoid repeating yourself.\n\n\n\nReducing errors: Copy + paste + modify is prone to errors (e.g., forgetting to change a variable name)\n\nEfficiency: If you need to update code, you only need to do it one place. This allows reuse of code within and across projects.\n\nReadability: Encapsulating code within a function with a descriptive name makes code more readable.\n\n\nCore parts of a function\nWhen you define a function, what does it look like?\n\nCode# Defining a function\nfunction_name &lt;- function(input_name_1, input_name_2 = default_value_2){\n\n  # function body - code that does something\n\n  return(output)\n}\n\n# Calling a function (all valid ways)\nfunction_name(input_name_1 = 2, input_name_2 = 4)\nfunction_name(2, 4)\nfunction_name(input_name_2 = 4, input_name_1 = 2)\nfunction_name(2)\n\n\nThe core parts of defining a function include:\n\n\nfunction() directive\n\nThis is what allows tells R to create a function.\n\n\n\nArguments/Inputs: the input_name_1 and input_name_2 – these are names of the function inputs\n\n\ndefault_value_2 is a default value that is used if no input values are provided when the function is called\n\n\n\nFunction body\n\nThe code inside the curly braces { } is where all the work happens. This code uses the function arguments to perform computations.\n\n\n\nReturn value\n\nWe can explicitly return an object by putting it inside return().\n\n\n\nHere are three examples that can help us learn a few properties of functions:\n\nCodeaverage &lt;- function(x, remove_nas) {\n    return(sum(x, na.rm = remove_nas)/length(x))\n}\naverage2 &lt;- function(x, remove_nas = TRUE) {\n    return(sum(x, na.rm = remove_nas)/length(x))\n}\n\naverage3 &lt;- function(x, remove_nas) {\n    sum(x, na.rm = remove_nas)/length(x)\n}\n\n\nNote:\n\nIn average2, the remove_nas argument has a default value of TRUE.\n\nWhen a function has default values for arguments, they don’t have to be provided when you call the function if you want to use the default value. See below:\n\nCode# Does throw an error\naverage(c(1, 2, 3, NA))\n\nError in average(c(1, 2, 3, NA)): argument \"remove_nas\" is missing, with no default\n\nCodeaverage(c(1, 2, 3, NA), remove_nas = TRUE)\n\n[1] 1.5\n\nCode# Doesn't throw an error\naverage2(c(1, 2, 3, NA))\n\n[1] 1.5\n\nCodeaverage2(c(1, 2, 3, NA), remove_nas = FALSE)\n\n[1] NA\n\n\n\nIf we don’t provide a return(), the last value that gets evaluated in the function body and isn’t stored as an object is what the function returns. (This is generally the last line without an assignment operator &lt;-.)\n\n\naverage3() is one example, but this can easily lead to errors.\nWe should explicitly return an object by putting it inside return().",

    "section": "Scope",
    "text": "Scope\nIn programming, scope refers to the area of a program where a named object is recognized and can be used.\n\nR uses lexical scoping, which means that the scope of a variable is determined by where it is created in the code.\n\nLexical scoping in R:\n\nWhen code refers to an object (e.g. data set, function, vector, etc.), R looks for the object in the current, local environment.\nIf it doesn’t find it, it continues to search by looking in the parent environment, and so on. The top-level environment is the global environment, the location where all interactive (i.e. outside of a function) computation and storage takes place.\n\nIf you save an object in R, outside a function local environment, it is stored in the global environment.\n\n\nIf R can’t find it in the global environment, it will look for it in loaded packages.\n\nWhen writing and using functions, the local environment is within the function itself.\n\nIf you define an object in the function, it won’t be accessible outside that function (unless you pass it as the output). See below:\n\n\nCodeaverage_new &lt;- function(x, remove_nas = TRUE) {\n    sum(x, na.rm = remove_nas)/length(x)\n  fun_new_thing_within_function &lt;- \"Fun times!\"\n}\naverage_new(1:3)\nfun_new_thing_within_function\n\nError: object 'fun_new_thing_within_function' not found\n\n\nScoping is important to consider if you try to refer to objects that aren’t passed as arguments.\n\nThis can be dangerous because if you re-use names of variables, it is easy to accidentally refer to a variable that is not the one you intended. See below:\n\n\nCodev &lt;- c(1,2,3)\n\naverage_new2 &lt;- function(x, remove_nas = TRUE) {\n    sum(x, na.rm = remove_nas)/length(x) + v\n}\n\n\naverage_new2(1:3)\n\n[1] 3 4 5\n\nCodev &lt;- c(4,5,6)\naverage_new2(1:3)\n\n[1] 6 7 8\n\n\nAnything created/saved/updated within a function that you want accessible outside that function needs to be passed to return(). See below:\n\nCodev &lt;- c(1,2,3)\n\naverage_new3 &lt;- function(x, remove_nas = TRUE) {\n  v &lt;- v + 10 # this is not changing v outside the function... \n  return(sum(x, na.rm = remove_nas)/length(x) )\n}\n\naverage_new3(1:3)\n\n[1] 2\n\nCodev\n\n[1] 1 2 3\n\n\nFor more about lexical scoping in R, see R Programming for Data Science",

    "text": "Calling a Function\nWhen you supply arguments to a function, they can be matched by position and/or by name.\nWhen you call a function without argument = value inside the parentheses, you are using positional matching.\n\nCodeggplot(diamonds, aes(x = carat, y = price)) + geom_point()\n\n\nThe above works because the first argument of ggplot is data and the second is mapping. (Pull up the documentation on ggplot with ?ggplot in the Console.) So the following doesn’t work:\n\nCodeggplot(aes(x = carat, y = price), diamonds) + geom_point()\n\nError in `ggplot()`:\n! `mapping` must be created with `aes()`.\n✖ You've supplied a tibble.\n\n\nBut if we named the arguments (name matching), we would be fine:\n\nCodeggplot(mapping = aes(x = carat, y = price), data = diamonds) + geom_point()\n\n\nSomewhat confusingly, we can name some arguments and not others. Below, mapping is named, but data isn’t. This works because when an argument is matched by name, it is “removed” from the argument list, and the remaining unnamed arguments are matched in the order that they are listed in the function definition. Just because this is possible doesn’t mean it’s a good idea–don’t do this!\n\nCodeggplot(mapping = aes(x = carat, y = price), diamonds) + geom_point()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nArgument matching\n\n\n\nIn general, it is safest to match arguments by name and position for your peace of mind. For functions that you are very familiar with (and know the argument order), it’s ok to just use positional matching.\n\n\n\n\nError Messages Diagnose the error message in the example below:\n\nggplot() |&gt;\n    geom_sf(census_data, aes(fill = population))\n    \nError in `layer_sf()`:\n! `mapping` must be created by `aes()`\nThe error message is that the positioning in geom_sf if wrong becuase it takes the mapping before it takes data, so right now it thinks the data is the mapping argument. In order to fix this either switch their locations or add the explict name to each of these.",

    "text": "The if-else if-else Control Structure\nOften in functions, you will want to execute code chunks conditionally. In a programming language, control structures are parts of the language that allow you to control what code is executed. By far the most common is the `if-else if-else structure.\n\nCodeif (logical_condition) {\n    # some code\n} else if (other_logical_condition) {\n    # some code\n} else {\n    # some code\n}\n\nmiddle &lt;- function(x) {\n    mean_x &lt;- mean(x, na.rm = TRUE)\n    median_x &lt;- median(x, na.rm = TRUE)\n    seems_skewed &lt;- (mean_x &gt; 1.5*median_x) | (mean_x &lt; (1/1.5)*median_x)\n    if (seems_skewed) {\n        median_x\n    } else {\n        mean_x\n    }\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo vectorize or not to vectorize\n\n\n\nThe if () else {} code is not vectorized; the logical condition in if() cannot be a logical vector of length longer than 1. If you want a vectorized version of conditional execution of code use if_else() or case_when(); these can be used in mutate().\n\n\n\n\nConvert Temp Write a function for converting temperatures that takes as input a numeric value and a unit (either “C” for Celsius or “F” for Fahrenheit). The function should convert the temperature from one unit to the other based on the following formulas:\n\n\nTo convert Celsius to Fahrenheit: (Celsius * 9/5) + 32\n\nTo convert Fahrenheit to Celsius: (Fahrenheit - 32) * 5/9\n\n\n\nCodeconvert_temp &lt;- function(num, unit) {\n  if (unit == \"C\") {\n     new_val &lt;- (num * 9/5) + 32\n     str_glue(\"{new_val} F\")\n  } \n  else if (unit == \"F\") {\n     new_val &lt;- (num - 32) * 5/9\n     str_glue(\"{new_val} C\")\n  }\n}\n\nconvert_temp(20, \"C\")\n\n68 F\n\nCodeconvert_temp(67, \"F\")\n\n19.4444444444444 C\n\n\n\n\nDomain Name Write a function that extracts the domain name of a supplied email address. The function should return the domain name (e.g., “gmail.com”). If the input is not a valid email address, return “Invalid Email”. (A valid email ends in “dot something”.)\n\n\nCodedomain_name &lt;- function(email) {\n  is_valid &lt;- (str_detect(email, \"@.+\\\\..+\"))\n  if (is_valid) {\n    str_extract(email, \"@.+$\")\n  }\n  else {\n    \"Invalid Email\"\n  }\n} \n\ndomain_name(\"tduckwor@macalester.edu\")\n\n[1] \"@macalester.edu\"\n\nCodedomain_name(\"tduckworth@gmail\")\n\n[1] \"Invalid Email\"\n\nCodedomain_name(\"tduckwor.com\")\n\n[1] \"Invalid Email\"\n\nCodedomain_name(\"tduckwor@gmail.\")\n\n[1] \"Invalid Email\"",

    "text": "Writing Functions with tidyverse Verbs\nPerhaps we are using group_by() and summarize() a lot to compute group means.

Must group by variables found in `.data`.\n✖ Column `group_var` is not found.\n\n\nWhat’s Going On?\nThe tidyverse uses something called tidy evaluation: this allows you to refer to a variable by typing it directly (e.g., no need to put it in quotes).\n\n\ngroup_by(group_var) is expecting a variable that is actually called group_var, and mean(mean_var) is expecting a variable that is actually called mean_var.\n\nTo fix this we need to embrace the variables inside the function with { var }:\n\nCodegroup_means &lt;- function(df, group_var, mean_var) {\n    df |&gt;\n        group_by({{ group_var }}) |&gt;\n        summarize(mean = mean({{ mean_var }}))\n}\n\n\nThe { var } tells R to look at what the variable specified by the input var rather than look for a variable called var.\n\nCodegroup_means(diamonds, group_var = cut, mean_var = carat)\n\n# A tibble: 5 × 2\n  cut        mean\n  &lt;ord&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 Fair      1.05 \n2 Good      0.849\n3 Very Good 0.806\n4 Premium   0.892\n5 Ideal     0.703\n\n\nLet’s group by both cut and color:\n\nCodegroup_means(diamonds, group_var = c(cut, color), mean_var = carat)\n\nError in `group_by()`:\nℹ In argument: `c(cut, color)`.\nCaused by error:\n! `c(cut, color)` must be size 53940 or 1, not 107880.\n\n\nOh No! What Now?!\nWhen c(cut, color) is put inside { c(cut, color) } within the function, R is actually running the code inside { }.\n\nThis combines the columns for those 2 variables into one long vector. What we really meant by c(cut, color) is “group by both cut and color”.\n\nTo fix this, we need the pick() function to get R to see { group_var } as a vector of separate variables (like the way select() works).\n\nCodegroup_means &lt;- function(df, group_var, mean_var) {\n    df |&gt;\n        group_by(pick({{ group_var }})) |&gt;\n        summarize(mean = mean({{ mean_var }}))\n}\n\n\n\n\nProp function Create a new version of dplyr::count() that also shows proportions instead of just sample sizes.

The number of things that you’re inserting should either be 1 or the size of the x[i] subset.\n\nCodex &lt;- c(first = \"one\", second = \"two\", third = \"three\", fourth = \"four\")\nx\n\n  first  second   third  fourth \n  \"one\"   \"two\" \"three\"  \"four\" \n\n\n\nCodex[c(1, 3)] &lt;- \"new\" # Replacement length is 1\nx\n\n first second  third fourth \n \"new\"  \"two\"  \"new\" \"four\" \n\n\n\nCodex &lt;- c(first = \"one\", second = \"two\", third = \"three\", fourth = \"four\")\nx[c(1, 3)] &lt;- c(\"new1\", \"new2\") # Replacement length is 2, and length of subset is 2\nx\n\n first second  third fourth \n\"new1\"  \"two\" \"new2\" \"four\" \n\n\n\nCodex &lt;- c(first = \"one\", second = \"two\", third = \"three\", fourth = \"four\")\nx[c(1, 3, 4)] &lt;- c(\"new1\", \"new2\") # BAD!

    "text": "Debugging Strategies\nWhen writing functions and working with functions that you wrote, you may encounter errors that are hard to figure out.\nHere are some strategies to help you debug the issues you encounter:\n\nUse print() and cat() to print out intermediate results and messages within a function.\n\nExamples: print(x), cat(\"The value of x is\", x, \"\\n\")\n\n\n\n\n\nCodeMy_own_sum &lt;- function(x){\n  print(x)\n  return(sum(x))\n}\nMy_own_sum(c(1,2,3))\n\nMy_own_sum &lt;- function(x){\n  cat(\"The value of x is\", x, \"\\n\")\n  cat(\"The class of x is\", class(x), \"\\n\")\n  return(sum(x))\n}\n\nMy_own_sum(c(1,2,3))\n\n\n\nUse browser() to pause the function at a certain point and interactively explore the environment. Press “Next” or type n to run the next line of code. Type the name of an object in the Console to see its value at this point in the function. You can type Q to quit the browser.\n\nExample below:\n\n\n\n\nCodefit_mod_and_extract &lt;- function(data, yvar, preds, pred_of_interest) {\n    # Use str_c to create a string (formula_str) that looks like \"yvar ~ pred1 + pred2\"\n    # Look at the documentation for a helpful argument\n    mod_formula_str &lt;- str_c(yvar, \"~\", str_c(preds, collapse = \"+\"))\n    mod_form &lt;- as.formula(mod_formula_str)\n    \n    # Add browser() to where in the function you'd like to pause and interact in the function environment using the Console\n    browser()\n    \n    # Fit a linear model using the constructed formula and given data\n    mod &lt;- lm(mod_form, data = data)\n    \n    # Obtain 95% confidence interval\n    ci &lt;- confint(mod, level = 0.95)\n    \n    # Return the coefficient estimate and CI for the predictor of interest\n    tibble(\n        which_pred = pred_of_interest,\n        estimate = mod$coefficients[pred_of_interest],\n        ci_lower = ci[pred_of_interest, \"2.5 %\"],\n        ci_upper = ci[pred_of_interest, \"97.5 %\"]\n    )\n}\n\n\nfit_mod_and_extract(data = mtcars, yvar = \"mpg\", preds = c(\"hp\", \"wt\"), pred_of_interest = \"hp\")\n\n\n\nUse try() to catch errors and print out a message when an error occurs.\n\nExample below:\n\n\n\n\nCodeMy_own_sum &lt;- function(x){\n  return(sum(x))\n}\n\nresults &lt;- My_own_sum(c(\"a\",\"b\",\"c\"))\nclass(results)\n\nresults &lt;- try(My_own_sum(c(\"a\",\"b\",\"c\")), silent = TRUE)\nclass(results)\n\n\n\nInclude if else statements within a function to ensure that you are passing the right type of input to a function. You can create you own custom error message with stop().\n\nExample below:\n\n\n\n\nCodeMy_own_sum &lt;- function(x){\n  if(!is.numeric(x)){\n    stop(\"Input must be numeric\")\n  }\n  return(sum(x))\n}\n\nresults &lt;- My_own_sum(c(\"a\",\"b\",\"c\"))\nclass(results)\n\nresults &lt;- try(My_own_sum(c(\"a\",\"b\",\"c\")), silent = TRUE)\nclass(results)",

    "text": "Case study: performing many different versions of an analysis\nOne of my most common use cases for writing functions and iteration/looping is to perform some exploration or modeling repeatedly for several different “settings”.\nFor example, our broad goal might be to fit a linear regression model to our data. However, there are often multiple choices that we have to make in practice:\n\nKeep missing values or fill them in (imputation)?\nFit the model only on a certain group of cases?\nFilter out outliers in one or more variables?\nTransform certain variables? (e.g., log transformation)\n\nWe can map any number of these choices to arguments in a custom model-fitting function:\n\n\nimpute: TRUE or FALSE\n\nfilter_to: This could be a string description like “All cases”, “Group 1”, or “Groups 1 and 2”\n\n\nCodefit_model &lt;- function(data, impute, filter_to) {\n    if (impute) {\n        data &lt;- some_imputation_function(data)\n    }\n    \n    if (filter_to==\"Group 1\") {\n        data &lt;- data |&gt; \n            filter(group == 1)\n    } else if (filter_to == \"Groups 1 and 2\") {\n        data &lt;- data |&gt; \n            filter(group %in% c(1,2))\n    }\n    \n    lm(y ~ x1 + x2, data = data)\n}\n\n\nThe tidyr package has a useful function called crossing() that is useful for generating argument combinations.\nFor each argument, we specify all possible values for that argument. crossing() generates all combinations:\n\nCodedf_arg_combos &lt;- crossing(\n    impute = c(TRUE, FALSE),\n    filter_to = c(\"All cases\", \"Group 1\", \"Groups 1 and 2\")\n)\ndf_arg_combos\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 2\n  impute filter_to     \n  &lt;lgl&gt;  &lt;chr&gt;         \n1 FALSE  All cases     \n2 FALSE  Group 1       \n3 FALSE  Groups 1 and 2\n4 TRUE   All cases     \n5 TRUE   Group 1       \n6 TRUE   Groups 1 and 2\n\nCode# Another example\ncrossing(\n    option1 = 1:3,\n    option2 = c(TRUE, FALSE),\n    option3 = c(\"low\", \"medium\", \"high\")\n)\n\n# A tibble: 18 × 3\n   option1 option2 option3\n     &lt;int&gt; &lt;lgl&gt;   &lt;chr&gt;  \n 1       1 FALSE   high   \n 2       1 FALSE   low    \n 3       1 FALSE   medium \n 4       1 TRUE    high   \n 5       1 TRUE    low    \n 6       1 TRUE    medium \n 7       2 FALSE   high   \n 8       2 FALSE   low    \n 9       2 FALSE   medium \n10       2 TRUE    high   \n11       2 TRUE    low    \n12       2 TRUE    medium \n13       3 FALSE   high   \n14       3 FALSE   low    \n15       3 FALSE   medium \n16       3 TRUE    high   \n17       3 TRUE    low    \n18       3 TRUE    medium \n\n\nWith iteration in our toobox, we can iterate the fit_model() function over the combinations in df_arg_combos.",

We’ll define outliers as cases whose carat is over 3 SDs away from the mean.\n\nWork with your partner on the following exercises. As you work, make note of what is challenging and any helpful thought processes/strategies that arise from the collaboration.\n\nUse crossing() to create the data frame of argument combinations for our analyses. Call it df_arg_combos. Note that you can create a list of formula objects in R with c(y ~ x1, y ~ x1 + x2).

The user should be able to supply the dataset (data), the variable to remove outliers in (what_var), and a threshold on the number of SDs away from the mean used to define outliers (sd_thresh). Write your function so that it runs as follows: remove_outliers(diamonds, what_var = carat, sd_thresh = 3).\n\n\nWrite a function called fit_model that implements the different settings for our diamonds analysis.\n\n\nCodefit_model &lt;- function(data, mod_formula, remove_outliers) {\n    # remove_outliers is a TRUE/FALSE flag of whether or not to remove outliers\n    # This function implements our specific use case: outliers are cases that are 3 SDs away from the mean for the carat variable\n    \n    # Use mod_formula as the first argument of lm()\n}\n\n\n\nWrite a for loop that stores the fitted linear models from all versions of the analysis.\n\nRecall that you can pull out the contents of a single data frame column in many ways. For a data frame df with a variable named x:\n\ndf$x\ndf |&gt; pull(x)\ndf[[\"x\"]]\n\nNote that in df_arg_combos:\n\n\nmod_formula: this column is a list and you can extract the 1st element with [[1]]\n\n\nremove_outliers: this column is a vector and you can extract the 1st element with [1]",

    "text": "Accessing web APIs directly\nGetting a Census API key\nMany APIs require users to obtain a key to use their services.\n\nThis lets organizations keep track of what data is being used.\nIt also rate limits their API and ensures programs don’t make too many requests per day/minute/hour. Be aware that most APIs do have rate limits — especially for their free tiers.\n\nNavigate to https://api.census.gov/data/key_signup.html to obtain a Census API key:\n\nOrganization: Macalester College\nEmail: Your Mac email address\n\nYou will get the message:\n\nYour request for a new API key has been successfully submitted. Please check your email. In a few minutes you should receive a message with instructions on how to activate your new key.\n\nCheck your email. Copy and paste your key into a new text file:\n\nFile &gt; New File &gt; Text File (towards the bottom of the menu)\nSave as census_api_key.txt in the same folder as this .qmd.\n\nRead in the key with the following code:\n\nCodecensus_api_key &lt;- readLines(\"census_api_key.txt\")\n\n\nNavigating API documentation\nNavigate to the Census API user guide and click on the “Example API Queries” tab.\nLet’s look at the Population Estimates Example and the American Community Survey (ACS) Example.\nThese examples walk us through the steps to incrementally build up a URL to obtain desired data. This URL is known as a web API request.\nhttps://api.census.gov/data/2019/acs/acs1?g et=NAME,B02015_009E,B02015_009M&for=state:*\nFor this request,\n\nwe can adjust the path to change desired dataset (acs1) and year\nwe can adjust the query string to get different variables (get) and for different states (for)\n\n?get=NAME,B02015_009E,B02015_009M&for=state:*\nTypically, each of these URL components will be specified in the API documentation.\nSometimes, the scheme, hostname, and path (https://api.census.gov/data/2019/acs/acs1) will be referred to as the endpoint for the API call.\nBuilding a URL with httr2\n\nWe will use the httr2 package to build up a full URL from its parts because of URLs need to be percent encoded.\n\n\nrequest() creates an API request object using the base URL\n\n\nreq_url_path_append() builds up the URL by adding path components separated by /\n\n\nreq_url_query() adds the ? separating the endpoint from the query and sets the key-value pairs in the query\n\nThe .multi argument controls how multiple values for a given key are combined.\nThe I() function around \"state:*\" inhibits parsing of special characters like : and *. (It’s known as the “as-is” function.)\nThe backticks around for are needed because for is a reserved word in R (for for-loops). You’ll need backticks whenever the key name has special characters (like spaces, dashes).\nWe can see from here that providing an API key is achieved with key=YOUR_API_KEY.\n\n\n\n\nCodereq &lt;- request(\"https://api.census.gov\") |&gt; \n    req_url_path_append(\"data\") |&gt; \n    req_url_path_append(\"2019\") |&gt; \n    req_url_path_append(\"acs\") |&gt; \n    req_url_path_append(\"acs1\") |&gt; \n    req_url_query(get = c(\"NAME\", \"B02015_009E\", \"B02015_009M\"), `for` = I(\"state:*\"), key = census_api_key, .multi = \"comma\")\n\n\nWhy would we ever use these steps instead of just using the full URL as a string?\n\nTo generalize this code with functions!\nTo handle special characters\n\ne.g., query parameters might have spaces, which need to be represented in a particular way in a URL (URLs can’t contain spaces)\n\n\nSending a request with httr2\n\nOnce we’ve fully constructed our request, we can use req_perform() to send out the API request and get a response.\n\nCoderesp &lt;- req_perform(req)\n\n\nGetting a response with httr2\n\nWe see from Content-Type that the format of the response is something called JSON. We can navigate to the request URL to see the structure of this output.\n\nWe can use resp_body_json() in httr2 to parse the JSON into a nicer R format.\n\nThis function uses fromJSON() behind the scenes.\nWithout simplifyVector = TRUE, the JSON is read in as a list.\n\n\n\n\nCoderesp_json_df &lt;- resp |&gt; resp_body_json(simplifyVector = TRUE)\n\n# Data Cleaning\nresp_json_df &lt;- janitor::row_to_names(resp_json_df, 1) |&gt; # Move 1st row to Names\n  as.data.frame() |&gt; # Convert Matrix to Data Frame\n  mutate(across(starts_with('B'), as.numeric)) # Convert all variables that start with B to numeric\n\nhead(resp_json_df)\n\n\nTo learn more about JSON, consult the following readings:\n\nA Non-Programmer’s Introduction to JSON\nGetting Started With JSON and jsonlite\nFetching JSON data from REST APIs",

We can navigate to the request URL to see the structure of this output.\n\nXML (Extensible Markup Language) is a tree structure of named nodes and attributes.\nWe can use resp_body_xml() to read in the XML as an R object.\n\n\nCoderesp &lt;- req_perform(req)\nresp\nresp &lt;- resp_body_xml(resp)\nresp\n\n\nThe XML output is not packaged in a nice way. (We’d love to have a data frame.) We can use the xml2 package to explore and navigate the XML structure to extract the information we need.\nLet’s first use the xml_structure() function to see how information is organized:\n\nCodexml_structure(resp)\n\n\nThe key navigation and extraction functions in xml2 are:\n\n\nxml_children(): Get nodes that are nested inside\n\nLike getting the first level bullet points inside a given bullet point\n\n\n\nxml_find_all(): Finds nodes matching an XPath expression (XPath stands for XML path)\n\nXPath expressions are like string regular expressions for XML trees\nSee here for a deeper dive into XPath\n\n\n\nxml_attr(): Selects the value of an attribute (the information to the right of the = in quotes)\n\n&lt;node_name attribute_name1=\"attribute_value1\" attribute_name2=\"attribute_value2\"&gt;\n\n\n\n\nCode# Get the item nodes in 2 different ways\nresp |&gt; xml_find_all(\"item\")\nresp |&gt; xml_children()\n\n# Get the item \"type\"\nresp |&gt; xml_find_all(\"item\") |&gt; xml_attr(\"type\")\n\n# The &lt;name&gt; and &lt;yearpublished&gt; nodes are nested within each &lt;item&gt;\nresp |&gt; xml_find_all(\"item/name\")\nresp |&gt; xml_find_all(\"item/yearpublished\") # Notice that this is length 8 instead of 9!\n\n# Get the \"primary\" or \"alternate\" designation for each name\nresp |&gt; xml_find_all(\"item/name\") |&gt; xml_attr(\"type\")\n\n\nExercises\n\nGet the board game name (e.g., “Murder Mystery…” and “Robinson Crusoe”)\n\n\nCoderesp |&gt; xml_find_all('item/name') |&gt; xml_attr(\"value\")\n\n\n\nGet the board game ID number (e.g., 63495, 40175)\n\n\nCoderesp |&gt; xml_find_all(\"item\") |&gt; xml_attr(\"id\")\n\n\nNew York Times API\nThis example will build on the New York Times Web API, which provides access to news articles, movie reviews, book reviews, and many other data.\nWe will specifically focus on the Article Search API, which finds information about news articles that contain a particular word or phrase.\nTo get started with the NY Times API, you must register and get an authentication key. Signup only takes a few seconds, and it lets the New York Times make sure nobody abuses their API for commercial purposes. It also rate limits their API and ensures programs don’t make too many requests per day. For the NY Times API, this limit is 1000 calls per day.\nOnce you have signed up, verified your email, log back in to https://developer.nytimes.com. Under your email address, click on Apps and Create a new App (call it First API) and enable Article Search API, then press Save. This creates an authentication key, which is a 32 digit string with numbers and the letters a-e.\nAs with your census API key, save this key in a .txt file, and read it in and store this in a variable called times_key.\n\nCodetimes_key &lt;- read_lines(\"nyt_api_key.txt\")\n\n\nOpen this URL in your browser (you should replace MY_KEY with the API key you were given).\nhttp://api.nytimes.com/svc/search/v2/articlesearch.json?q=gamergate&api-key=MY_KEY\nThe text you see in the browser is the response data (in JSON format).\nThis URL has the same structure that we discussed above for the census API:\n\n\nhttp:// — The scheme, which tells your browser or program how to communicate with the web server. This will typically be either http: or https:.\n\napi.nytimes.com — The hostname, which is a name that identifies the web server that will process the request.\n\n/svc/search/v2/articlesearch.json — The path, which tells the web server what function you would like to call (a function for searching articles).\n\n?q=gamergate&api-key=MY_KEY — The query parameters, which provide the parameters for the function you would like to call. The key value pairs are the following:\n\n\n\nkey\nvalue\n\n\n\nq\ngamergate\n\n\napi-key\nMY_KEY\n\n\n\nThe scheme, hostname, and path (http://api.nytimes.com/svc/search/v2/articlesearch.json) together form the endpoint for the API call.\nWe can use the httr2 package to build up a full URL from its parts:\n\nCodereq &lt;- request(\"http://api.nytimes.com\") |&gt; \n    req_url_path_append(\"svc\") |&gt; \n    req_url_path_append(\"search\") |&gt; \n    req_url_path_append(\"v2\") |&gt; \n    req_url_path_append(\"articlesearch.json\") |&gt; \n    req_url_query(q = \"gamergate\", `api-key` = times_key)\n\n\nWe can write a function to generate the URL for a user-specified query:\n\nCodecreate_nyt_url &lt;- function(query, key) {\n    request(\"http://api.nytimes.com\") |&gt; \n        req_url_path_append(\"svc\") |&gt; \n        req_url_path_append(\"search\") |&gt; \n        req_url_path_append(\"v2\") |&gt; \n        req_url_path_append(\"articlesearch.json\") |&gt; \n        req_url_query(q = query, `api-key` = key)\n}\n\n\nLet’s use this function to find articles related to:\n\n\nFerris Bueller's Day Off (note the spaces and the apostrophe)\n\nPenn & Teller (note the spaces and the punctuation mark &)\n\nLet’s see how these queries are translated into the URLs:\n\nCodereq_fb &lt;- create_nyt_url(query = \"Ferris Bueller's Day Off\", key = times_key)\nreq_pt &lt;- create_nyt_url(query = \"Penn & Teller\", key = times_key)\n\n\nWe can use req_perform() to send out the request and resp_body_json() to parse the resulting JSON:\n\nCoderesp_pt &lt;- req_pt |&gt; req_perform() |&gt; resp_body_json(simplifyVector = TRUE)\n\n\nExploring complex lists\nresp_pt is a list. A list is a useful structure for storing elements of different types. Data frames are special cases of lists where each list element has the same length (but where the list elements have different classes).\nLists are a very flexible data structure but can be very confusing because list elements can be lists themselves!\nWe can explore the structure of a list in two ways:\n\nEntering View(list_object) in the Console. The triangle buttons on the left allow you to toggle dropdowns to explore list elements.\nUsing the str() (structure) function.\n\nUsing base R subsetting, we can access elements of a list in three ways:\n\nBy position with double square brackets [[:\n\n\nCode# This gets the first element of the list\nresp_pt[[1]]\n\n\n\nBy name with double square brackets [[: (note that list elements are not always named, so this won’t always be possible)\n\n\nCode# Accessing by name directly\nresp_pt[[\"status\"]]\n\n# Accessing via a variable\nwhich_element &lt;- \"status\"\nresp_pt[[which_element]]\n\n\n\nBy name with a dollar sign $: (Helpful tip: For this mode of access, RStudio allows tab completion to fill in the full name)\n\n\nCoderesp_pt$status\n\n\nWe can retrieve these nested attributes by sequentially accessing the object keys from the outside in. For example, the meta element would be accessed as follows:\n\nCoderesp_pt$response$meta\n\n\nExercise: In the resp_pt object, retrieve the data associated with:\n\nthe copyright key\nthe number of hits (number of search results) within the meta object\nthe abstracts and leading paragraphs of the articles found in the search\n\n\nCoderesp_pt[['copyright']]\nresp_pt$response$meta$hits\n\nresp_pt$response$docs |&gt; \n  select(abstract, print_section)\n\n\nlead_paragraph doesn’t exist for me so I used print_section.",

For example, on the NIH News Releases page, we can see that the data is represented in a consistent pattern of image + title + abstract.\nWe will identify data in a web page using a pattern matching language called CSS Selectors that can refer to specific patterns in HTML, the language used to write web pages.\nFor example:\n\nSelecting by element/tag type:\n\n\n\"a\" selects all hyperlinks in a webpage (“a” represents “anchor” links in HTML)\n\n\"p\" selects all paragraph elements\n\n\nSelecting by class and ID:\n\n\n\".description\" selects all elements with class equal to “description”\n\nThe . at the beginning is what signifies class selection.\nThis is one of the most common CSS selectors for scraping because in HTML, the class attribute is extremely commonly used to format webpage elements. (Any number of HTML elements can have the same class, which is not true for the id attribute.)\n\n\n\n\"#mainTitle\" selects the SINGLE element with id equal to “mainTitle”\n\nThe # at the beginning is what signifies id selection.\n\n\n\n\n\n&lt;p class=\"title\"&gt;Title of resource 1&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p class=\"description\"&gt;Description of resource 1&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p class=\"title\"&gt;Title of resource 2&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p class=\"description\"&gt;Description of resource 2&lt;/p&gt;\nWarning: Websites change often! So if you are going to scrape a lot of data, it is probably worthwhile to save and date a copy of the website (File &gt; Save As). Otherwise, you may return after some time and your scraping code will include all of the wrong CSS selectors.\nAlthough you can learn how to use CSS Selectors by hand (CSS Selectors), we will use a shortcut by installing the Selector Gadget tool.\n\nThere is a version available for Chrome–add it to Chrome via the Chome Web Store.\n\nMake sure to pin the extension to the menu bar. (Click the 3 dots &gt; Extensions &gt; Manage extensions. Click the “Details” button under SelectorGadget and toggle the “Pin to toolbar” option.)\n\n\nThere is also a version that can be saved as a bookmark in the browser–see here.\n\nLet’s watch the Selector Gadget tutorial video before proceeding.",

We’ll talk about this in the next section.\n\nFor now, we’ll use DBI to connect with an in-process database (duckdb), one that runs locally on your computer.\n\nA nice feature of duckdb is that even if your dataset is huge, duckdb can work with it very quickly.\n\nWe can set up a database connection with dbConnect() and initialize a temporary database with duckdb():\n\nCodecon &lt;- DBI::dbConnect(duckdb::duckdb())\nclass(con)\n\n[1] \"duckdb_connection\"\nattr(,\"package\")\n[1] \"duckdb\"\n\n\nIn a real project, we would use duckdb_read_csv() to store data directly into the duckdb database without first having to read it into R.\nIn the toy example below, we have a dataset on Spotify songs (all_spotify_songs.csv) and store in a database table called \"songs\":\n\nCodeduckdb_read_csv(con, \"songs\", \"https://hash-mac.github.io/stat212site-f25/relative/path/to/all_spotify_songs.csv\")\n\n\nHere, we’ll use datasets from the nycflights13 package.\nThe DBI package provides the dbWriteTable() function to write dataset objects (in constrast to csv files) to a database:\n\nCodedbWriteTable(con, \"flights\", nycflights13::flights)\ndbWriteTable(con, \"planes\", nycflights13::planes)\n\n\nWe can use tbl(), short for table, to create connections individually to the flights and planes datasets.\n\nCodeflights &lt;- tbl(con, \"flights\")\nplanes &lt;- tbl(con, \"planes\")\n\n\nNote that the results of tbl() are not quite the same as our normal data frames.\nAlthough they have class tbl, note that the number of rows is NA!\nThe full dataset isn’t loaded into memory when we use tbl, so the number of rows is unknown. This behavior is purposeful–it reduces computer resources and allows access to parts of the data only when needed.\n\nCodeclass(flights)\n\n[1] \"tbl_duckdb_connection\" \"tbl_dbi\"               \"tbl_sql\"              \n[4] \"tbl_lazy\"              \"tbl\"                  \n\nCodedim(flights)\n\n[1] NA 19",

    "text": "SQL Practice\nStack Exchange Data Explorer\nWe will experiment with the Stack Exchange Data Explorer, a website that provides a SQL interface for all the data in StackExchange.\nStackExchange powers the StackOverflow programming question and answer site, but it also powers question and answer sites related to 126 topics including English, Travel, Bicycles, and Parenting.\nStackExchange provides an in-depth Data Explorer Tutorial. We start with this interface to construct SQL queries on the Travel Data Explorer.\nInstructions\nHead to the Stack Exchange Data Explorer for Travel.\nYou will see a list of queries other users have created in the past. These queries are for all Stack Exchange sites, so some may not be relevant. Queries about your activity (for example, “How many upvotes do I have for each tag?”) will not be useful either if you do not have activity for the particular site.\nClick on one of them and you see the SQL code for the query.\nThen click the “Run Query” button to get results.\nFor example, you might look at the number of up vs down votes for questions and answers by weekday and notice that for questions, Tuesday has the highest up vs. down vote ratio and Saturday has the lowest. You can contemplate hypotheses for this difference!\nSelect Queries\nLet’s experiment with our own queries.\nClick on “Compose Query” in the upper right, and notice the tables are shown in the right.\nAs a reminder, a table is similar to a data frame.\n\nEach table lists the columns stored within the table and the data types for the columns.\nLook through the tables for Posts, Users, and Comments.\nDo the columns generally make sense, and correspond to the StackOverflow website?\n\nThere’s a description of the tables and columns (called a schema) available on StackExchange’s Meta Q&A Site.\nNow enter your first query in the text box and click the “Run Query” button:\n\nCodeSELECT TOP(100) Id, Title, Score, Body, Tags\nFROM Posts\n\n\nIn this query we already see several important features of SQL:\n\n\nSELECT tells SQL that a query is coming.\n\nTOP(100) only returns the first 100 rows.\n\nNote: The StackExchange data explorer uses a variant of SQL called Transact SQL that is supported by Microsoft databases. TOP(100) is a non-standard SQL feature supported by T-SQL. For most databases you would accomplish the same goal by adding LIMIT 100 to the end of the query.\n\n\n\nId, Title, Score, Body, Tags determines what columns are included in the result\n\nFROM Posts determines the source dataset.\n\nFrom glancing at the results, it appears that this table contains both questions and answers.\nLet’s try to focus on answers.\nLooking again at the Schema Description, notice that there is a PostTypeId column in Posts, and a value of 1 corresponds to questions.\nLet’s update our query to only include questions:\n\nCodeSELECT TOP(100)\nId, Title, Score, Body, Tags\nFROM Posts\nWHERE PostTypeId = 1\n\n\nThe SQL command WHERE is like the filter command we have been using in dplyr.\n\nNote that whereas we used the double equals == for comparison in R, the SQL WHERE command takes just a single =.\n\nExercise: Find the title and score of Posts that have a score of at least 110. Hint: TOP is not necessary here because you want all result rows.\n\nCodeSELECT title, score\nFROM Posts\nWHERE score &gt;= 110 AND PostTypeID = 1\n\n\nExercise: Find posts whose title contains some place you are interested in (you pick!). Hint: use SQL’s LIKE operator.\n\nCodeSELECT title \nFROM Posts\nWHERE title LIKE ('%Ireland%') AND PostTypeId = 1\n\n\nNote that you can look up the actual webpage for any question using its Id.\nFor example, if the Id is 19591, the webpage URL would be https://travel.stackexchange.com/questions/19591/. Look up a few of the questions by their Id.\nIt’s unclear how the 100 questions we saw were selected from among the over 43,000 total questions.\n\nTo count the number of posts, we can use COUNT in SQL: SELECT COUNT(Id) FROM Posts Where PostTypeId = 1.\n\nLet’s try to arrange the Posts by score.\n\nCodeSELECT TOP(100)\nId, Title, Score, Body, Tags\nFROM Posts\nWHERE PostTypeId = 1\nORDER BY Score DESC\n\n\nThe ORDER BY ??? DESC syntax is similar to R’s arrange(). You can leave off the DESC if you want the results ordered smallest to largest.\nWe could also find the highest rated questions tagged “italy”:\n\nCodeSELECT TOP(100)\nId, Title, Score, Body, Tags\nFROM Posts\nWHERE PostTypeId = 1 AND Tags LIKE '%italy%'\nORDER BY Score DESC\n\n\nExercise: Pick two tags that interest you and you think will occur together and find the top voted posts that contain both.\n\nCodeSELECT TOP(100)\nId, Title, Score, Body, Tags\nFROM Posts\nWHERE PostTypeId = 1 AND Tags LIKE '%scams%' AND Tags LIKE '%travel%'\nORDER BY Score DESC\n\n\nSQL Summarization\nSo far, we have covered the equivalent of R’s selecting, filtering, and arranging.\nLet’s take a look at grouping and summarizing now, which has similar structures in both R and SQL. Imagine we want to see how many posts of each type there are. This query shows us that there are 44K questions and 71K answers.\n\nCodeSELECT \nPostTypeId, COUNT(Id) numPosts\nFROM posts\nGROUP BY PostTypeId \nORDER BY PostTypeId\n\n\nNote two characteristics of SQL summarization here:\n\nThe GROUP BYclause indicates the table column for grouping, much like R’s group_by.\nThere is no explicit summarize. Instead, all columns that appear in the SELECT except for those listed in GROUP BY must make use of an aggregate function. COUNT(*) is one of these, and is the equivalent of R’s n(). Many other aggregate functions exist, including MAX, SUM, AVG, and many others. Every aggregate function requires a column as an argument (even COUNT() which doesn’t logically need one).\nThe aggregate column (in this case COUNT(Id)) must immediately be followed by a name that will be used for it in the results (in this case numPosts). This can be particularly useful if you want to order by the aggregated value.\n\nExercise: Change the previous query so it orders the result rows by the number of posts of that type. Hint: Reuse the name you assigned to the aggregate function.\n\nCodeSELECT PostTypeId, COUNT(Id) numPosts\nFROM posts\nGROUP BY PostTypeId \nORDER BY numPosts\n\n\nExercise: Find the most commonly used tagsets (sets/combinations of tags) applied to posts. Note that this is not asking you to count the most common individual tags — this would be more complex because multiple tags are squashed into the Tags field.\n\nCodeSELECT Tags, COUNT(Tags) numTagsets\nFROM posts\nGROUP BY Tags\nORDER BY  numTagsets\n\n\nSQL Joins\nFinally, as with R, we often want to join data from two or more tables. The types of joins in SQL are the same as we saw with R (inner, outer, left, right). Most commonly we want to perform an INNER join, which is the default if you just say JOIN. (We can look up the inner_join() documentation to remind ourselves what an inner join does.)\nLet’s say we wanted to enhance the earlier query to find the highest scoring answers with some information about each user.\n\nCodeSELECT TOP(100)\nTitle, Score, DisplayName, Reputation\nFROM Posts p\nJOIN Users u\nON p.OwnerUserId = u.Id\nWHERE PostTypeId = 1\nORDER BY Score Desc\n\n\nWe see a few notable items here:\n\nThe JOIN keyword must go in between the two tables we want to join.\nEach table must be named. In this case we named posts p and users u.\nWe need to specify the relationship that joins the two tables. In this case, a posts OwnerUserId column refers to the Id column in the users table.\n\nExercise: Create a query similar to the one above that identifies the authors of the top rated comments instead of posts.\n\nCodeSELECT TOP (100)\nText, Score, DisplayName, Reputation, Views, AboutMe\nFROM Comments c\nJOIN Users u\nON c.UserID = u.ID\nORDER BY Score Desc\n\n\nIf you want more practice, go to https://mystery.knightlab.com/.",

    "text": "Shiny\nShiny facilitates building interactive web applications using R code without needing extensive knowledge of web coding technologies such as HTML, CSS, and Javascript.\nSetup\nThe neighborhood diversity app was made with the Shiny toolkit available in the shiny R package.\nDownload and leave open the Shiny cheatsheet.\nLet’s look at an example app together. RStudio will create a template app when you go to File –&gt; New File –&gt; Shiny Web App then enter/select the following values:\n\nfor the Application name, type neighborhood_diversity.\nfor Application type, leave the default option Single file (app.R)\n\n\nThis creates a folder in your current directory called neighborhood_diversity with a single R code file called app.R.\nClick the Run App button in the top right of the source code editor to view the app in action.\nThe app.R has three components:\n\na user interface object (ui): to set up the layout of the app\na server function (server): to define how the app will react to user input\na call to the shinyApp() function: to launch the app using the UI object (ui) and server function (server) created above\nGetting Acquainted\nSetup part 1: Load required packages at the top of app.R: shiny, tidyverse, sf, and plotly.\nSetup part 2: Data download and folder setup\nSave the two files, diverse_data_by_dist.rds and diverse_data_by_year.csv, with the folder setup below inside your portfolio repository.\n\n📂 neighborhood_diversity\n\napp.R\n📂 data\n\ndiverse_data_by_dist.rds\ndiverse_data_by_year.csv\n\n\n\n\n\nSetup part 3: Below your library() calls, add the following commands to read in the data:\n\nCodedata_by_dist &lt;- read_rds(\"data/diverse_data_by_dist.rds\")\ndata_by_year &lt;- read_csv(\"data/diverse_data_by_year.csv\")\n\n\nGetting acquainted with the app and underlying code: Take a few minutes to explore the code:\n\n\nui section. How are functions nested inside each other, and how does this seem to relate to the visual appearance of the app?\nWhat names/labels in the User Interface (ui) part of the app seem to be shared with the server part of the app?\nData Codebook\nThe data_by_dist dataset is an sf object (cases = census tracts) with the following variables:\n\n\nmetro_id: numeric ID for the city\n\nmetro_name: city name\n\ngeometry: information about the spatial geometry for the tract\n\ntract_id: numeric census tract ID\n\ndistmiles: distance in miles from this tract to city hall\n\nentropy: a measure of the diversity of a census tract (a diversity “score”)\nRace variables (each of these is the number of people)\n\n\naian: American Indian\nasian\nblack\nhispanic\ntwo_or_more\nwhite\n\n\n\nThe data_by_year dataset has a subset of the above variables as well as a year variable.\n\n*Input() functions\nWhat do these do? The *Input() functions collect inputs from the user.\nWhere are these functions on the cheatsheet? Right-hand side of the first page\nWhere do these go in the app?\n\nAll *Input() functions go in the ui part of the app.\nPay careful attention to the nesting of the functions in the ui section. For example, in a sidebarLayout(), these *Input() functions should go in the sidebarPanel() (as opposed to the mainPanel()).\nSeparate multiple *Input() functions with commas.\n\nHow do the function arguments work? In all the *Input() functions, the first two arguments are the same:\n\n\ninputId is how you will refer to this input in the server portion later. You can call this anything you want, but make this ID describe the information that the user is providing.\n\nlabel is how this will actually be labeled in your UI (what text shows up in the app).\n\nEach function has some additional arguments depending what you want to do.\nYour Turn\nAdd the following two user inputs to your app:\n\nDropdown to select the city name\nSlider to choose the span parameter for the scatterplot smooth\n\nThis parameter varies from 0 to 1. Lower values result in a wiggly smoothing line, and higher values result in a smoother line.\n\n\n\nUse the Shiny cheatsheet to find the *Input() functions that correspond to the two inputs above. Add them to the appropriate place within the ui object. Use commas to separate the inputs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nParentheses Pandemonium\n\n\n\nCarefully formatting your code will be crucial here! With shiny UIs, it is very easy to lose or mismatch parentheses, which leads to frustrating errors. My suggestion is to place parentheses as follow:\nsliderInput(\n    argument1 = value1,\n    argument2 = value2,\n    argument3 = value3\n)\nNote how the left parenthesis is on the same line as the function, and the right parenthesis is on its own line and left-aligned with the start of the function name.\nTip: In RStudio, you can place your cursor next to any parenthesis to highlight the matching parenthesis (if there is one).\n\n\nYou will have to look at the documentation for the *Input() functions to know how to use arguments beyond inputId and label. To view this documentation, type ?function_name in the Console.\nTo get the collection of city names from the data_by_dist dataset, you can use the following:\nmetro_names &lt;- data_by_dist |&gt; pull(metro_name) |&gt; unique()\nPut this metro_names code just beneath where you read in the data.\nOnce you finish, run your app. Make sure you can select and move things around as expected. You won’t see any plots yet—we’ll work on those in the next exercises.\n\n*Output() functions\nWhat do these do? *Output() functions in the ui portion work with the render*() functions in the server portion to to add R output (like plots and tables) to the UI.\nWhere are these functions on the cheatsheet? Bottom-center of the first page\nWhere do these go in the app?\n\nAll *Output() functions go in the ui part of the app.\nPay careful attention to the nesting of the functions in the ui section. For example, in a sidebarLayout(), these *Output() functions should go in the mainPanel() (as opposed to the sidebarPanel()).\nSeparate multiple *Output() functions with commas.\n\nHow do the function arguments work? In all the *Output() functions, the first argument is the same:\n\n\noutputId works just like inputId for *Input() functions. This is how you will refer to this output in the server portion later. You can call this anything you want, but make this ID describe the output being created.\n\nYour Turn\nAdd 3 outputs to the ui that will eventually be:\n\nA scatterplot of diversity score (entropy) versus distance to city hall (distmiles) with a smoothing line (smoothness controlled by the span parameter on your slider input)\nA map of diversity scores across the counties in the selected city\nA bar chart of the overall race distribution in the selected city (i.e., the total number of people in each race category in the city)\n\nFor now, don’t worry that the layout of the plots exactly matches the original neighborhood diversity app. (You will update this in your homework.)\nRun the app with the output. Notice that nothing really changes. Think of the outputs you just placed as placeholders—the app knows there will be a plot in the UI, but the details of what the plots will look like and the R code to create them will be in the server portion. Let’s talk about that now!\n\nrender*() functions\nWhat do these do? The render*() functions use R code (i.e., standard ggplot code) to communicate with (“listen to”) the user inputs to create the desired output.\nWhere are these functions on the cheatsheet? Bottom-center of the first page. The render*() function you use will depend on the desired output. The bottom center of the cheatsheet shows how *Output() and render*() functions connect.\nWhere do these go in the app? The render*() functions go in the server function of the app.\nIn general, the server section of code will look something like this:\n\nCode# Suppose the following are somewhere in the UI part\nnumericInput(inputId = \"min_year\")\nnumericInput(inputId = \"max_year\")\nplotOutput(outputId = \"plot_over_years\")\n\nserver &lt;- function(input, output) {\n    output$plot_over_years &lt;- renderPlot({ # Note the curly braces that enclose the R code below\n        ggplot(...) +\n            scale_x_continuous(limits = c(input$min_year, input$max_year))\n    })\n}\n\n\nYour Turn\nWhile our main goals is to make 3 plots, you will just make one of them in this exercise.\nAdd a renderPlot() functions inside the server portion of the code to make the scatterplot of diversity score (entropy) versus distance to city hall (distmiles) with a smoothing line. Use the data_by_dist dataset. Reference the inputs you’ve already created in previous exercises by using filter() and ggplot() to render the desired interactive plot.\nNote: the geom_??? used to create the smoothing line has a span parameter. (Check out the documentation for that geom by entering ?geom_??? in the Console.)\nRun the app and check that the scatterplot displays and reacts to the chosen city and span parameter.\nAs part of Homework 9, you will finish this Shiny app.",

    "text": "plotly package\nThe plotly package provides tools for creating interactive web graphics and is a nice complement to Shiny.\nGetting Started\n\nCodelibrary(plotly)\n\n\nA wonderful feature of plotly is that an interactive graphic can be constructed by taking a regular ggplot graph and putting it inside the ggplotly() function:\n\nCodedata(babynames, package = \"babynames\")\nbnames &lt;- babynames |&gt; filter(name %in% c(\"Brianna\", \"Briana\", \"Breanna\"))\n\np &lt;- ggplot(bnames, aes(x = year, y = prop, color = sex, linetype = name)) +\n    geom_line() +\n    theme_classic() +\n    labs(x = \"Year\", y = \"Proportion of names\", color = \"Gender\", linetype = \"Name\")\n\nggplotly(p)\n\n\n\n\n\nThe plotly package can also create animations by incorporating frame and ids aesthetics.\n\n\nframe = year: This makes the frame of the animation correspond to year–so the animation shows changes across time (years).\n\nids = country: This ensures smooth transitions between objects with the same id (which helps facilitate object constancy throughout the animation). Here, each point is a country, so this makes the animation transition smoothly from year to year for a given country. (For more information, see here.)\n\n\nCodelibrary(gapminder)\n\n\n\nCodedata(gapminder, package = \"gapminder\")\np &lt;- ggplot(gapminder, aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp, color = continent, size = pop)) +\n    geom_point(aes(frame = year, ids = country)) +\n    scale_x_log10() +\n    labs(x = \"GDP per capita\", y = \"Life expectancy (years)\", color = \"Continent\", size = \"Population\") +\n    theme_classic()\n#ggplotly(p)\n\n\nYour Turn\nIn a web application, having plots be plotly objects is just nice by default because of the great mouseover, zoom, and pan features.\nInside app.R, change plotOutput to plotlyOutput and renderPlot to renderPlotly for the scatterplot and the barplot. Make sure to add calls to ggplotly() too.\nAs part of Homework 9, you will incorporate advanced plotly into the Shiny App.",
